# MOONSHINERS – A Polish Bootlegging Simulator
Moonshine '90 is a first-person simulator game set in the gritty reality of post-communist Poland. It's the early 1990s – the People's Republic has fallen, capitalism is creeping in, and you're just a small-town hustler trying to make a living... by producing and distributing illegal alcohol.

🥃 Game Concept
You step into the worn-out shoes of a self-made moonshiner. Using homemade stills, rusty tools, and your wits, you'll need to:

Brew and distill your own high-proof alcohol.

Upgrade your equipment to increase production.

Avoid nosy neighbors, the police, and government inspectors.

Sell your product through shady contacts and black markets.

Balance money, risk, and reputation.

🇵🇱 Inspired by Real History

  The game draws inspiration from the underground economy of early 90s Poland:

  The fall of the PRL (People's Republic of Poland).

  The rise of entrepreneurship and post-communist chaos.

  Aesthetic of concrete blocks, Trabants, and smuggled Western goods.
